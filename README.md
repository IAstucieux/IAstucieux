# IAstucieux
 Python library that allows easy use of AIs like Llama2 and Stable Diffusion and more.

### What is IAstucieux ? 
IAstucieux is a project carried out as part of our 3rd year of IT BUT

## Introduction
This library allows the use of Llama2 and Stable Diffusion through the use of "Automatic 1111". We are developing a framework that allows the use of these programs locally.

This project contains also the creation of a toolkit as a library that enables the easy use of some AI models
such as [Llama2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama) and [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion), and that can be extended with additional AI models.<br/>
You will be able to use the models you installed through the library that is being developed here.

This project uses Python *3.9.2*, [Llama2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama) and [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) are included in the base installation.
